Jimi Hendrix adapted Waters' \"Rollin' Stone\" for \"Voodoo Chile,\" Bob Dylan found inspiration in it for \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards took their band's name from it.

No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation – a nation of teens suddenly turned punk – and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator. The weight of fame led already troubled singer-guitarist Kurt Cobain to take his own life in 1994.

Lyrically, Cobain raged in code – shorthand grenades of inner tumult and self-loathing. His genius, though, in songs like \"Lithium,\" \"Breed\" and \"Teen Spirit\" was the soft-loud tension he created between verse and chorus, restraint and assault. Cobain was a pop lover at heart – and a Beatlemaniac: Nevermind producer Butch Vig remembers hearing Cobain play John Lennon's \"Julia\" at sessions. Cobain also fought to maintain his underground honor. Ultimately, it was a losing battle, but it is part of this album's enduring power.

Hendrix made soul music for inner space. \"It's a collection of free feeling and imagination,\" he said of the album. \"Imagination is very important.\" Widely assumed to be about an acid trip, \"Purple Haze\" had \"nothing to do with drugs,\" Hendrix insisted. \"'Purple Haze' was all about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea.\""},

That January, the Beatles were on the verge of a breakup, exhausted and angry with one another after the disastrous sessions for the aborted Get Back LP, later salvaged as Let It Be [see No. 392]. Determined to go out with a sense of recaptured glory, the group reconvened at EMI's Abbey Road Studios to make its most polished album: a collection of superb songs cut with an attention to refined detail, then segued together (especially on Side Two) with conceptual force. There was no thematic link, other than the Beatles' unique genius. John Lennon veered from the stormy metal of \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" to the exquisite vocal sunrise of \"Because.\" Paul McCartney was saucy (\"Oh! Darling\"), silly (\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\") and deliciously bitter (\"You Never Give Me Your Money\"). George Harrison proved his long-secret worth as a composer with \"Something\" and the folk-pop diamond \"Here Comes the Sun,\" written in his friend Eric Clapton's garden while playing hooky from a business meeting. And Lennon, McCartney and Harrison reputedly sang more three-part harmony here than on any other Beatles album. Let It Be was the group's final release, but this album was its real goodbye."},

It was no idle boast. Much of what we take for granted in rock would not exist without this New York band or its seminal debut: the androgynous sexuality of glitter; punk's raw noir; the blackened-riff howl of grunge and noise rock; goth's imperious gloom. Recorded dirt-cheap at a studio that was literally falling apart, it is a record of fearless breadth and lyric depth. Singer-songwriter Lou Reed documented carnal desire and drug addiction, decadence and redemption, with a pop wisdom he learned as a song-factory composer for Pickwick Records. Cale introduced the power of pulse and drone (from his work with minimalist composer La Monte Young); guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker played with tribal force; Nico, a German vocalist added to the band by manager Andy Warhol, brought an icy femininity to the heated ennui in Reed's songs. Rejected as nihilistic by the love crowd in '67, the Banana Album (so named for its Warhol-designed cover) is the most pro­phetic rock album ever made."},

But at the time it was made, Kind of Blue was a revolution all its own, a radical break from everything going on. Turning his back on standard chord progressions, trumpeter Miles Davis used modal scales as a starting point for composition and improvisation – breaking new ground with warmth, subtlety and understatement in the thick of hard bop. Davis and his peerless band – bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Jimmy Cobb, pianist Bill Evans, and the titanic sax team of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley – soloed in uncluttered settings, typified by \"melodic rather than harmonic variation,\" as Davis put it. Two numbers, \"All Blues\" and \"Freddie Freeloader\" (the latter featured Wynton Kelly at the ivories in place of Evans), were in 12-bar form, but Davis' approach allowed his players a cool, new, collected freedom. Evans wrote in his original liner notes, \"Miles conceived these settings only hours before the re­cording dates and arrived with sketches which indicated to the group what was to be played. Therefore, you will hear something close to pure spontaneity in these performances.\" Or as the late critic Robert Palmer wrote, \"Kind of Blue is, in a sense, all melody – and atmosphere.\" The bass line in \"So What\" is now among the most familiar obbligatos in jazz, and there is no finer evocation of the late-night wonder of jazz than the muted horns in \"All Blues.\""},

Elvis Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black were horsing around with \"That's All Right, Mama,\" a tune by bluesman Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup, when producer Sam Phillips stopped them and asked, \"What are you doing?\" \"We don't know,\" they said. Phillips told them to \"back up and do it again.\" The A side of Presley's first single (backed with a version of Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\"), \"That's All Right\" was issued by Sun on July 19th. It may or may not be the first rock & roll record. But the man who would be King was officially on wax. Bridging black and white, country and blues, his sound was playful and revolutionary, charged by a spontaneity and freedom that changed the world. \"It's the blues,\" critic Greil Marcus wrote in his classic book Mystery Train. \"But free of all worry, all sin; a simple joy with no price to pay.\" Presley released four more singles on Sun – including definitive reinventions of Wynonie Harris' \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" and Junior Parker's \"Mystery Train\" – before moving on to immortality when Phillips sold his contract to RCA for $35,000. Incredibly, it took more than 20 years for Presley's Sun output to be properly collected on a 1976 LP – which has since been superseded by this 1999 double-CD chronicle of the King's beginnings at Sun. It collects everything he cut at the studio, including alternate takes and the 1953 acetate he recorded as a gift for his mother as a shy and awkward recent high school graduate."},

Yet the creative tension resulted in one of the most intense and adventurous rock albums ever made. Lennon pursued his hard-edged vision into the cynical wit of \"Sexy Sadie\" and \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun,\" but also infused \"Julia\" and \"Dear Prudence\" with childlike yearning. Paul McCartney's playful pop energy came through on his inversion of Chuck Berry's American values, \"Back in the U.S.S.R.,\" and he showed off his raucous side in \"Helter Skelter.\" Harrison's spiritual yearning led him to \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" featuring a guest guitar solo from Eric Clapton.

Produced with no-surrender energy by legendary Seventies studio madman Guy Stevens, the Clash's third album skids from bleak punk (\"London Calling\") to rampaging ska (\"Wrong 'Em Boyo\") and disco resignation (\"Lost in the Supermarket\"). The album was made in dire straits too. The band was heavily in debt and openly at war with its record company. Singer-guitarists Joe Strummer and Mick Jones wrote together in Jones' grandmother's flat. \"Joe, once he learned how to type, would bang the lyrics out,\" Jones said. \"Then I'd be able to bang out some music while he was hitting the typewriter.\" Strummer, Jones, bassist Paul Simonon and drummer Topper Headon spent nearly three months rehearsing and demoing songs in a garage in the Pimlico section of London – \"with one light and filthy carpet on the walls for soundproofing,\" recalled Strummer in 1989. \"We felt that we were struggling,\" he said, \"about to slide down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails.\" But Stevens was on hand for inspiration. He threw chairs around the room \"if he thought a track needed zapping up,\" according to Strummer. The album ends with \"Train in Vain,\" a rousing song of fidelity (unlisted on the back cover because it was added at the last minute) that became the sound of triumph: the Clash's first Top 30 single in the U.S."},

In the existential shuffle \"Tumbling Dice,\" the exhausted country beauty \"Torn and Frayed\" and the whiskey-soaked uplift of \"Shine a Light,\" you literally hear the Stones in exile: working at Richards' villa in the South of France, and on the run from media censure, British drug police (Jagger and Richards already knew the view from behind bars) and the country's onerous tax code. Exile is rife with allusions to their outsider status: The album's cover is a collage of freakish American characters, and on \"Sweet Black Angel\" they toast imprisoned activist Angela Davis – one set of renegades to another. The music rattles like battle but also swings with clear purpose on songs like \"Rocks Off\" and \"All Down the Line.\" As Richards explained, \"The Stones don't have a home anymore – hence the Exile – but they can still keep it together. Whatever people throw at us, we can still duck, improvise, overcome.\" Great example: Richards recorded his jubilant romp \"Happy\" with just producer Jimmy Miller on drums and saxman Bobby Keys – while waiting for the other Stones to turn up for work.
